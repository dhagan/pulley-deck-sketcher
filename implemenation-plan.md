I've documented all 25 feature categories covering your complete sketching requirements:

Summary of All Features
Core Sketching (1-6):

Snap-to (grid, points, angles, components)
Length measurements & constraints
Pulley components (diameter, sheaves 1-3, attachment points, beckets)
Anchor points (fixed, load, labels)
Rope routing (tangent calculation, path visualization)
Triple pulley full support
Advanced Sketching (7-10):

Selection & manipulation (drag, resize, multi-select, copy/paste)
Precision input (coordinates, dimensions, angles, formulas)
Visual aids (grid, rulers, guidelines, measurements)
Layers & organization (component layers, background, annotations)
Analysis (11-15):

Mechanical graph generation
Force analysis (MA, tensions, anchor forces)
Friction modeling (sheave, bearing, rope friction)
Results display (panels, labels, force arrows)
Animation (16-17):

Motion simulation (pull animation, speed control)
Force visualization (animated arrows, tension waves)
UI/UX (18-23):

Import/export (save/load, images, data)
Toolbar, properties panel, canvas controls
Keyboard shortcuts
Technical (24-25):

Performance (60 FPS, 1000+ components)
Responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile)
